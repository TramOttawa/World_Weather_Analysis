# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
My app was improved and modified so that it contains weather descriptions along with our weather data. Customers will be able to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. In additions, a travel itinerary and travel map were also created as well as a marker layer map.

## Results
This map takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. Information such as weather description, temperature, and country are listed.

This takes the search information from the search folder and uses directions API to create a vacation itinerary. I have discovered four cities in Brazil, that are Touros, Nisia Floresta, Cabedelo and Pitimbu.

Some popup markers were added with information on the cities which was useful for the itinerary.
